## Lightening talks presentation for PHPNE (UK, Newcastle).

This short talk aims to quickly pull together the concepts of some of the building
blocks of a Laravel 5.1 application. They include features that have been in Laravel
for some time, in various forms, but which some people may not be familier.

Slides are hosted here:

http://judgej.github.io/PHPNE-Laravel-Architecture/#/

The Laravel documentation goes into detail in how to use these features, but leaves
out any wider descriptions on how to recognise when you need to use them.

The features include:

* Commands
* Jobs
* Scheduled Tasks
* Events
* Queues

The code samples leave out various sections for clarity, so use them in conjunction
with the officials Laravel 5.1 documentation.

There are no speaker notes yet - I intend to add those to provide some reasoning
behind examples.
