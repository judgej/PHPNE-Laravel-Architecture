					# Introducing

					* Commands
					* Jobs
					* Events
					* Sheduler
					* Queues

					What they are ~ When to use them ~ How they work

					Note:
					- Not intending to cover how to use them; see the L5.1 docs.
					- L5.1 rather than 5.2 as it is an LTS release.
					- Please interrupt to ask questions at any time

						# Commands

						* Runs as CLI
						* `artisan` is the shell interface
						* Handles stdin, stdout, params, options
						* Can be interactive (prompts, menus, progress bar)
						* Closely linked to scheduler
						* L5.0 "commands" are now "jobs"

						Note:
						- artisan is a PHP shell script.
						- Can be piped, redirected etc like any shell command.
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						# Commands

						## Where do they come from?

						* Many built-in
						* Custom commands under `App\Console\Commands`
						* Packages can bring their own
						* Run `artisan` so see the list of commands
						* Organised into groups (a scope)

						Note:
						- Scopes include route, migrate, make, etc.
						- Commands recognise and support applications that are more than
						  just web requests; very powerful.
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						# Commands

						## What goes in them?

						* Just the user interface (keep it lean)
							* Input (stdin and prompted)
							* Output
							* Arguments and Options
							* Final result code
						* Exception handler can be handy

						Note:
						- The command is just a shell for interacting with the user.
						- The main functionality should really be put somewhere else.
						- Letting exceptions fall through is a last resort; try to catch 
						  and present a user error.
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						# Commands

						## Example - define it

						<pre><code>
							&lt;?php namespace App\Console\Commands;

							class Hello extends Command
							{
								protected $signature = 'demo:hello';
								public function handle()
								{
									$this->info(sprintf(
										'Number of arguments: %d',
										count($this->argument())
									));
								}
							}
						</code></pre>

						Note:
						- A very simple command to tell you how many parameters have been passed in.
						- Shows output (info message) and access to arguments.
						- As elsewhere, much left out of this for clarity; read the official docs.
					</section>


					<section data-markdown>
						# Commands

						## Example - register it

						<pre><code>
							&lt;?php namespace App\Console;

							class Kernel extends ConsoleKernel
							{
								// This array registers custom commands with Laravel.

								protected $commands = [
									...
									\App\Console\Commands\Hello::class,
								];
							}
						</code></pre>

						Note:
						- Each command given as the full namespaced name.
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						# Commands

						## Example - run it

						From the bash shell command line:

						<code class="bash">
							$ ./artisan demo:hello 1 2 3
							Number of params: 3
							$
						</code>

						There are commands to help you create commands.

						Can also run a command from a controller.
						But why?

						Note:
						- This is run from a shell prompt here.
						- Keep commands for CLI interaction; there are better ways to
						  run code through a controller.

						# Queues

						## Purpose

						* Certain objects can be run **asynchronously**
							* Commands
							* Jobs
							* Events

						A queueing system is where these objects queue up, waiting to be processed.

						Note:
						- A queue is generally FIFO and is dumb - it just holds some data.
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						# Queues

						## Queue Management Services

						* Database
						* Beanstalkd
						* IronMQ
						* etc.

						Note:
						- Database requires no additional tools or system services,
						  and is good for development.
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						# Queues

						## The Laravel approach

						* Object serialised and thrown onto a queue
						* A queue worker deserialises and executes the object

						Laravel wraps queued tasks with into objects that *just run*;
						it does all the hard work for you

						A job can be set so it is queued by default when dispatched

						Note:
						- Object is JSON serialised.
						- Laravel tries to store IDs rather than objects, so it can fatch them later.
					</section>
				</section>


				<section data-background="#9999cc" data-separator-notes="^Note:">
					<section data-markdown>
						# Jobs

						* A job is a self-contained block of processing that has no
						user interaction.
						* A job is *usually* run asynchronously; we don't need to wait for it to finish.
						* Examples: send an email, run a report, archive old data.

						Note:
						- It can interact using event broadcasting, connecting it to
						  the user's browser through a complex channel.
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						# Jobs

						Give a job class the `ShouldQueue` interface, and it will queue
						automatically when dispatched.

						<pre><code>
							&lt;?php namespace App\Jobs;
							use Illuminate\Contracts\Queue\ShouldQueue;

							class CheckOrders extends Job implemkents ShouldQueue
							{
								public __construct($data_to_work_on) {
									$this->data_to_work_on = $data_to_work_on;
								}

								public function handle(AnyProvider $provider, ...)
								{
									// Do its stuff
								}
							}
						</code></pre>

						Note:
						- The majority of jobs will be run like this; it is the main
						  purpose of jobs.
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						# Jobs

						## When would you dispatch a job?

						* To separate the trigger from the action
							* When something happens (an event) something else needs to be done (the job)
						* When you need to return control to the user quickly
							* Dispatch an asynchronous job

						Note:
						- A trigger may fire one job today, and several jobs tomorrow as requirements unfold.

						# Events

						Events are a game of two halves:

						* Registered events *happen*
						* Listeners are *notified*

						Note:
						- Listeners don't actually "listen". They register themselves and are
						  notified when they are needed.
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						# Events

						## The event architecture

						* Ultimately each event has a name and an event class
						* The event class holds the data for the event listeners
						* One or more listeners can be registered against an event
						* The listener is handed the event (with its data) when despatched
						* A listener can be a class or a closure

						Note:
						- The L5.1 documentation shows events looking in at different abstract levels,
						  and that can hide much of its depth.
						- Registered listeners are just in a big array, keyed on the event name.
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						# Events

						## Where are events defined?

						Mostly:

						* System events
						* Eloquent events
						* Custom events

						Note:
						- Often custom events will be fired from eloquent events, after a simple check.
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						# Events

						## Syntactic sugar

						Next three slides are all equivalent.

						<pre><code>
							// Register a closure to run when the Order model is updated.

							\App\Order::updated(function(\App\Order $order) {
								// Do stuff given order
							});
						</code></pre>

						Note:
						- We register a closure as an "updated" event on the Eloquent model.
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						# Events

						## Syntactic sugar
						<pre><code>
							// What the eloquent "updated" event registration actually does.

							Event::listen(
								'eloquent.updated: App\Order', // Event name
								function(\App\Order $order) {
									// Do stuff given order
								}
							);
						</code></pre>

						Note:
						- This is the name of the event that the previous example constructs and registers for you.
						- This name is used here just to understand; it may change in Laravel core, so buyer beware.
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						# Events

						## Syntactic sugar
						<pre><code>
							&lt;?php namespace App\Providers;

							class EventServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
							{
								protected $listen = [
									'eloquent.updated: App\Order' => [
										// Custom listener class to do stuff
										'App\Listener\OrderUpdated',
									],
									...
								];
							}
						</code></pre>

						Note:
						- This $listen array is just a convenince, and nothing special.
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						# Events

						The provider listener array is for custom listener classes.

						<pre><code>
							&lt;?php namespace App\Providers;

							class EventServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
							{
								protected $listen = [
									'App\Events\OrderComplete' => [
										// Custom listener class to do stuff
										'App\Listener\OrderComplete',
									],
									...
								];
							}
						</code></pre>

						Then fire the `App\Events\OrderComplete` event from the eloquent `updated` event when the
						status of the order goes to "COMPLETE".

						Note:
						- The name of a custom event is its namespaced name.
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						# Events

						If order has changed to COMPLETE then fire the custom event
						from this `updated` Eloquent event.

						<pre><code>
							\App\Order::updated(function(\App\Order $order) {
								// Order has changed status to COMPLETE.
								if (
									$order->getOriginal()['status'] != 'COMPLETE'
									&& $order->status == 'COMPLETE'
								) {
									Event::fire(new App\Events\OrderComplete($order));
								}
							});
						</code></pre>

						An artisan command will create the event and listener classes from
						the array in the event provider.

						Note:
						- Register this during the application boot; you want to register events and
						  listeners early.
					</section>

				</section>



				<section data-background="#cc3333" data-separator-notes="^Note:">
					<section data-markdown>
						# Task Scheduling

						Using `cron` you can schedule artisan commands to run at different times and intervals.

						<pre><code>
							# crontab
							# send outstanding emails every five minutes
							*/5 * * * * php artisan demo:send_emails
							# send payment reminders at 8am daily
							0 8 * * * php artisan demo:send_payment_reminders
							# etc
						</code></pre>

						Or let laravel manage the schedules in code for you.

						<pre><code>
							# Call scheduler every minute
							* * * * * php artisan schedule:run >/dev/null 2>&1
						</code></pre>

						Note:
						- The cron shedule parameters are great, but not friendly.
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						# Task Scheduling

						<pre><code>
							&lt;?php namespace App\Console;

							class Kernel extends ConsoleKernel
							{
								protected function schedule(Schedule $schedule)
								{
									$schedule->command('demo:send_payment_reminders')
										->dailyAt('8:00');

									// etc for other jobs
								}
							}
						</code></pre>

						The fluent scheduling options build into a cron schedule.
						Each minute Laravel then decides which of the console commands to run.

						Note:
						- There is a great range of fluent schedule options.
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						# Task Scheduling

						* All commands will run as if from the command line (system shell, artisan).
						* A command can be set to never run concurrently with itself (long running commands).
						* The schedule can be a custom function.
						* If a command misses its time slot, then it waits for next time.
						* Output can be directed to a log file.

						Note:
						- Often scheduled commands must not be allowed to run concurrently.
						- A custom schedule may run a command every hour, during each weekend after fulk Moon.
						  cron could never do that.
					</section>

				</section>

				<section data-background="#3333cc" data-separator-notes="^Note:">
					<section data-markdown>
						# Summary

						* **Commands** run through artisan and can be scheduled or queued.
						* **Jobs** have no user interaction and can be run asynchronously (i.e. queued).
						* **Events** help separate concerns and keep each unit cleaner.
						* **Scheduled Tasks** schedule commands through code.
						* All these help to keep the app fast and responsive and easily extendable.

						Note:
						- None
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						Pulling all these components together
						![Example system overview](Drawing1.png)

						Note:
						- A command fetches remote transactions and stores them in a model.
						- The model fires a created event which fires a custom New Transaction job.
						- The job is deserialised from the queue, given the transaction, which it can then process.
